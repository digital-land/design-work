A user needs to find a dataset and:

* Understand if it is useful for them
* Have confidence in the quality/authenticity of the dataset

How can we make the first/summary page for any dataset consistent? Especially, for the 2 different types of datasets; large and wide (Brownfield) and small and deep (Local plans)

Can we increase confidence by showing a glimpse of what is behind the curtain?
We need a light touch way to demonstrate the value - why use this data?

**Recommendation**: Scrap the long intro on Brownfield

Are all the datasets National datasets?

When downloading the dataset, what is the user getting?

* Format
* Size

**Question**: Are users able to download subsets of the data? Is that something we are going to offer or is that for someone else to do? E.g. developer just wants brownfield sites from the London area

Having Feedback loops should increase trust in the data and ease any fears that the data wonâ€™t be kept up to date

* what kind of feedback do we want at this point
* what tyoe of feedback could a user (consumer or LA) want to give us
* what mechanisms could be used for giving feedback
* how do we manage feedback

### Other notes/questions

How do we group the data for exploration?  
Does splitting by publisher always make sense? Will it be redundant on certain datasets?  
Would we want to split another way?
