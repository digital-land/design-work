## Data consumer needs

All these needs apply to data consumers but we have attempted to group them into common scenarios.

### First time visitor

* I need housing data to build a successful business.
* I need to know where to look for digital land data.
* I need to know what data is available from digital land
* I need to know what digital land data I can use now and in the future.
* I need to quickly know the dataset contains the data my service needs.
* I need to know how I get hold of the data I’m interested in.
* I need to know if I can use this dataset by itself or if I need someting else to make sense of it
* I need to know if everything I need to use this dataset is available from digital land
* Could rephrase as: I need to know the other things, associated with this dataset, that are needed for my service to be fully usable
* I need to have a high level of confidence in the data so that my business can rely on it
* I need to understand if a dataset is maintained and kept up to date
* I need to be able to manipulate the data to it works for my service.
* I need to be confident in the data I’ll be using for my service

### Reporting an issue 

Being able to report an issue and see it acted upon will show the user the dataset is "active" and that they can trust the data.

* I need to understand if there’s a process in place to fix data so that I confidently use the data.
* I need a quick and easy way of reporting an error so it doesn’t take too long.
* I need a way to explain what the error is.
* I need to know that my feedback will be acted upon.
* I need to be confident datasets are maintained and up-to-date.
