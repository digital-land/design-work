## Notes on Site structure

For each planning concept (think brownfield land, local plan, tpo, cpo, etc):

* project pages (phases, research, needs, prototypes, background)
* specification - how the concept can be express as data
* guidance
    * how you create the data (using the  schemas?) if you arenâ€™t using software that generates/exports it
    * where you should publish the data, and why?
* collector - the thing that goes out, collects data about a concept and processes it
* dataset - the data, in the shape we want it, ready to be downloaded and used
    * data is more useful the more people that use it - want to persuade people to use it (trust, provenance, authority)
    * what things support the quality and authority of the data?
    * clear and open terms of use
    * ability to understand where it comes from
    * to know when it changes
    * to know how frequently it changes, is there a delay in using the latest data
    * if there is a problem with the data, how to fixed?
