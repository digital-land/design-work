Purpose: See how local plan data should be structured?

Local plans title followed by "local plans, neighbourhood plansâ€¦" is confusing. Rework content?
Not sure what the bullet points are.

What are you downloading? Why? - is it a distraction on the page?

**Recommendation**: Schema list should be split into data publisher related schemes and the lists/schemas that are MHCLG maintain

**Recommendation**: Create and publish (on our site) the data for the MHCLG maintained registers.

**Recommendation**: one liner that explains what each schema defines

Questions

* Could draft guidance be generated from the same schema files?
* How do we handle changes to the list of schemas? Users could be using them!
* Is there a way to get support?
* Should there be a visual representation of how these schemas relate? Is this scalable?
