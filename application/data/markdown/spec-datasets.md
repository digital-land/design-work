Purpose: Discover the datasets that have defined specifications?

What is this page about? The actual data? Or specifications?

**Recommendation**: Should be a clearer visual separation between the consuming data section of the site (consumer) and the technical documentation parts of the site (publisher). E.g. 2 dataset pages where title is Dataset and then lists datasets.

What are you downloading? Why? - is it a distraction on the page?

Would it be helpful to know if an underlying schema has been updated?
