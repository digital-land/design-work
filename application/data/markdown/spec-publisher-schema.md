Purpose: explains what fields make up a given schema

Who is this for and what is this for?
Is it suppose to help LA users create data or is this for users who are building service that either produce data (Exacom) or consume data (RIPA)? Or both?

Is it to help users understand a schema or is it to help users understand how this schema fits in the bigger picture (which other schemas does it reference).

Key information (fields) and the metadata should be more clearly separated.

Would a description on each field help?

**Recommendation**: indicate when the schema last changed

**Recommendation**: separate regular register fields from schema specific ones
