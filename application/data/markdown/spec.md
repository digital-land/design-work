How do users find this page? How do users end up this page?
Who will use these pages?
Is it technical documentation?

Once guidance is written would a local authority user use the schema pages?

## Issues
Not clear what it is for, no context, no description
At minimum there should be text that explains what the 5 things are

There is no focus (if task orientated), what should a user do?
**Are the dataset specifications the most important thing?**

Not sure what the download the data section is for and why users would download ?
Could a user be confused by this? Could they think it is the schema they are downloading?

## Quick wins

* content introducing page
* one liner explaining each of the 5 things
